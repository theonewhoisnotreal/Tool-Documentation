4. Run MCC.exe.
5. If this is your first time running it, it will print out your HWID which you will have to send in the #request-whitelist channel.
6. To start the collector, use command $collect.

## Notes üßæ

1. If your bot sends +f and you don't get a response then you either don't have Levy in your server, or Members+ has no more servers for you to join. You can check this yourself, it's not a bug. Don't report it.
2. Bot will stop itself after you're in 95 servers.

## Warnings ‚ö†

1. This is a self-bot, it's against Discord's TOS.
2. The nature of using self-bots is that you will increase your chances of getting banned, especially with bots like this that require to send many requests to Discord's API.
3. USE AN ALT, unless you want your main to get banned.
4. I am not responsible for anything that happens to your account, these tools are by no means safe at all and you are not required to use them but if you do it is your responsibility.
